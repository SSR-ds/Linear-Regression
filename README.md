Linear Regression


This  folder consists of two projects worked under Linear Regression by me.

Project 1 :
USA_Housing:
• Implemented Linear Regression of USA_Housing Dataset to find out the coefficients that determine the price of a square feet or a house in a particular locality. 
•	Together a boston housing dataset(real world dataset) has been analyzed and insights have been drawn out from that. The MAE,MSE,RMSE has been determined through this.

Project 2:
E-commerce insights                                                                                                    
•	Implemented Multivariate Linear Regression model to facilitate decision making on a Kaggle E-commerce dataset using Python and obtained an accuracy of 98%
•	Projected the insights and predictors correlation in Python 2D Visualization
